# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create text cleaning service module

  - Create a new service file for text cleaning functionality
  - Implement the cleanText function that accepts raw text and OpenAI client
  - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for the service
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Implement GPT-5 text cleaning logic

  - Create the cleaning prompt template for GPT-5
  - Implement the OpenAI API call using the chat completions endpoint
  - Add response parsing to extract cleaned text
  - Handle GPT-5 specific model configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

  - Implement try-catch blocks around text cleaning calls
  - Add timeout handling for cleaning requests
  - Create fallback logic to return original text on failures
  - Add appropriate error logging
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [x] 4. Update the transcription API endpoint

  - Modify the existing /api/transcribe/route.ts to integrate text cleaning
  - Update the response format to include cleaned text
  - Ensure the same OpenAI client is reused for both transcription and cleaning
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 5. Add TypeScript interfaces for enhanced responses

  - Create interfaces for the new response format
  - Update existing type definitions to support cleaned text
  - Ensure type safety throughout the text cleaning flow
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 6. Write unit tests for text cleaning service

  - Create test cases for successful text cleaning scenarios
  - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Mock OpenAI client responses for testing
  - Test prompt formatting and response parsing
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Write integration tests for the enhanced API
  - Test the complete flow from file upload to cleaned text response
  - Test both Azure OpenAI and public OpenAI configurations
  - Test error scenarios and fallback behavior
  - Verify response format matches expected interface
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_
